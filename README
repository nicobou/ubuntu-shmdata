shmdata
=======
Library to share flows of data frames between processes via shared memory. 
shmdata can be compared to the JACK audio connection kit project or to the
VideoJack project. shmdata, although providing a similar service for 
any kind of data stream, does not provide (yet) reader and writer discovery. 
Note that shmdata readers and writers can hot connect/disconnect/reconnect/... 
and that a shared memory supports a single writer with multiple readers.

Several libraries are provided: 

* libshmdata for hot plugging between GStreamer pipelines (C library)
* libshmdata-any for sharing custom data flows without including GStreamer headers (C library)
* libshmdata-osg for receiving video written to a shared memory into an OpenSceneGraph texture (C++ library)
