Description: Library to share flows of data frames between processes via shared memory. 
 shmdata can be compared to the JACK audio connection kit project or to the
 VideoJack project. shmdata, however, does not provide yet reader and 
 writer discovery. 
 Note that shmdata readers and writers can hot connect/disconnect/reconnect/... 
 and that a shared memory supports a single writer with multiple readers.
 .
 This package contains headers, documentation and static libraries.
